1. mathstat.py -
   The main idea is to run mathstat.py in command line alongwith a text file. The program is going to read each numbers in the line
   and return the count of the numbers, the sum of the numbers and their standard deviation. 
   In order to run the file, first we need to run mathstat.py using the following command: 
   python mathstat.py <file.txt>    ----  file.txt could be replaced by small.txt , medium.txt, large.txt
   Next up run 'python mincemeat.py -p changeme localhost'
   
   This would give the count, sum and standard deviation respectively. 
   
   
   
2. freq.py -
   This code takes in a text file in command line and gives the number of occurances of each characters and the percentage of its
   occurance in ascending order. 
   To run the code, first up we need to run 'python freq.py mobydick.txt'.
   Next we run 'python mincemeat.py -p changeme localhost'. 
   
   The program lists all the characters and its occurances in ascending order. 


3. passCrack.py  
   This program takes a hashed password(first 5 chars) in the command line and returns all the combinations of password which has 
   the same first five hashed characters. 
   To run the program type the following: python passCrack.py d077f
   In a different prompt run 'python mincemeat.py -p changeme localhost'
